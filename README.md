# üß¨ Summit Biotech Attrition Analysis

[üëâ View my Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/danielggak/biotech-attrition-analysis?kernelSessionId=116188868). All questions and insights I wanted to discover are all noted in the Notebook. 

## ‚úçÔ∏è A little story behind the Notebook 
April 2022, I started challenging myself with [BOLT UBC Hackathon](https://www.boltbootcamps.com/events/bolt-ubc-bootcamp-2022-sponsored-by-accenture). At that time, I decided to apply my limitted knowledge about Python analysis tools and libraries such as ```Pandas``` and ```Matplotlib``` to solve the case. However, I didn't feel comfortable with them so it took me ages to wrap me head around the dataset. I found it interesting when pulling out some new insights and it made me want to discover more. Slow but fun. Obviously, 24 hours was too short for me to get anything done so I decided to keep that pace, relax and just got to watch the final pitch to know how the other teams deal with this case. 

And it's worth it as I always tried to get back to my Jupyter Notebook and create a new version of my analysis even though the competition was over. Eight months after that, I rolled out the third version of this notebook and hosted it on Kaggle. This time, I asked more deeper questions, explored more aspects of the dataset where I have never touched before, did more complex transformation and extremely comfortable to use ```Pandas```, ```Matplotlib``` and ```Plotly``` to answer questions that I want. 

This is defintely not the final version of it as there is still room for me to improve. I'd love to hear any thoughts or recommendations that you have.

üíñ Thank you for reading till the end and I'll keep posted if there is anything new.
